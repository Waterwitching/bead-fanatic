## What You'll Learn

This tutorial will teach you the fundamental skills needed for beadwork:
- How to measure and cut elastic cord
- Basic bead threading techniques
- How to create secure knots
- Finishing techniques for a professional look

## Materials Needed

### Essential Supplies
- **Elastic cord**: 0.7mm clear elastic (about 25cm)
- **Seed beads**: Size 8/0 or 6/0 in your favourite colours (approximately 60-80 beads)
- **Scissors**: Sharp fabric or craft scissors
- **Ruler or measuring tape**
- **Beading needle** (optional but helpful)

### Optional Supplies
- **Crimp beads**: For extra security
- **Clear nail varnish**: To seal knots
- **Bead mat**: To prevent beads rolling away

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Measure Your Wrist
1. Use a flexible measuring tape or string to measure around your wrist
2. Add 2.5cm (1 inch) for comfort and the knot
3. Cut your elastic cord to this length

**Top Tip**: It's better to cut slightly longer than too short - you can always trim excess!

### Step 2: Plan Your Design
1. Lay out your beads on a bead mat or towel
2. Arrange them in the pattern you want
3. Count your beads to ensure you have enough

**Design Ideas**:
- **Random mix**: Use various colours for a fun, casual look
- **Gradient**: Arrange colours from light to dark
- **Pattern repeat**: Create a simple ABAB or ABCABC pattern

### Step 3: Begin Threading
1. If using a needle, thread the elastic through it
2. Start threading beads according to your planned design
3. Slide each bead down the cord, leaving about 5cm free at the start

**Threading Tips**:
- Work slowly to avoid dropping beads
- If elastic frays, trim the end and start fresh
- Keep tension gentle - don't stretch the elastic whilst threading

### Step 4: Check the Fit
1. Once you've threaded enough beads, wrap the bracelet around your wrist
2. It should sit comfortably without being too tight
3. Add or remove beads as needed

### Step 5: Secure the Bracelet
1. Tie the ends of the elastic together with a double knot
2. Pull gently to test the security
3. Tie another knot for extra security
4. Trim excess elastic, leaving about 2mm

**Finishing Options**:
- **Basic**: Simple double knot
- **Secure**: Add a dab of clear nail varnish to the knot
- **Professional**: Use a crimp bead to hide the knot

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Elastic keeps breaking**:
- Use higher quality elastic cord
- Don't stretch whilst threading
- Check for sharp edges on beads

**Bracelet too loose/tight**:
- Measure wrist again and adjust bead count
- Remember elastic will stretch slightly over time

**Beads sliding around**:
- Use smaller bead holes
- Consider using crimp beads as spacers

**Knot coming undone**:
- Use multiple knots
- Seal with clear nail varnish
- Consider surgeon's knot for extra security

## Variations to Try

### Colour Combinations
- **Ocean**: Blues and greens with white accents
- **Sunset**: Oranges, pinks, and yellows
- **Monochrome**: Different shades of the same colour
- **Classic**: Black and white pattern

### Pattern Ideas
- **Striped**: Alternate between two colours
- **Ombré**: Gradual colour transition
- **Accent**: Mostly one colour with occasional contrasts
- **Random**: Mixed colours for a playful look

## Care Instructions

### Daily Care
- Remove before swimming or showering
- Store flat to prevent stretching
- Keep away from sharp objects

### Cleaning
- Wipe gently with a damp cloth
- Use mild soap if needed
- Air dry completely before storing

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered this basic bracelet:
1. Try **memory wire bracelets** for a different technique
2. Learn **crimp bead techniques** for more secure finishes
3. Experiment with **different bead sizes and shapes**
4. Try **multi-strand designs**
