## What Are Seed Beads?

Seed beads are small, generally round beads that are the foundation of most beadwork. Despite their name, they're not made from seeds but get their name from their size - similar to small seeds.

## Sizes and Measurements

Seed beads are measured using the aught system:
- **15/0**: Smallest, about 1.5mm
- **11/0**: Most popular size, about 2.2mm  
- **8/0**: Medium size, about 3mm
- **6/0**: Larger, about 4mm

*The larger the number, the smaller the bead!*

## Types and Origins

### Czech Seed Beads
- Slightly irregular shape adds character
- Wide range of colours and finishes
- Excellent value for money
- Traditional European production

### Japanese Seed Beads (Miyuki, Toho)
- Extremely uniform in size and shape
- Larger holes for easier threading
- Premium quality and consistency
- Higher price but superior results

## Finishes and Effects

### Standard Finishes
- **Opaque**: Solid, non-transparent colours
- **Transparent**: See-through with colour tint
- **Translucent**: Semi-transparent, frosted appearance

### Special Finishes
- **Matte**: Non-shiny, frosted surface
- **Metallic**: Shiny metal-like appearance
- **Rainbow/AB**: Iridescent coating
- **Lined**: Clear bead with coloured interior
- **Galvanised**: Metallic electroplated finish

## Popular Techniques

### Loom Weaving
Creates flat, fabric-like beadwork using a bead loom.

### Off-Loom Stitches
- **Peyote stitch**: Creates a brick-like pattern
- **Brick stitch**: Similar to peyote but worked differently
- **Herringbone**: Creates a V-shaped pattern
- **Right angle weave**: Creates a flexible, net-like structure

## Choosing the Right Seed Beads

### For Beginners

## Working Tips

### Thread Selection
